% getStimProfiles()
% Return a millisecond-resolution copy of the optogenetic stimulus profile from each of a set of trials. Start and 
% end times are specified by input arguments.  The profile is constructed using the optoStepTimeMS and optoStepPowerMW 
% arrays. If "normalize" is true, the power profiles will be normalized between zero and one. "alignRT" true aligns
% the profiles on the reaction time, rather than the stimulus on time.

% When we are RT aligned, we must check that we have enough time on each trial to span the full kernel.  This isn't
% a problem for proper RT alignment. For for early alignment, the RT could approach the start of the trial.
% The "prepend" code will fill in the blank with the value in the first bin, but this means that a few trials that
% do this filling on most of the kernel can dominate, causing an artificial, progressing offset.  To avoid this,
% we screen for these trials and eliminated them.

    The stimProfile is an integral number of pulses long.  We need to pad it out at the head and tail to make it 
    have a length of (endTimeMS - startTimeMS).  This is all pretty simple to implement if the startBin isn't the
    first bin.  That shouldn't really happen, but it does, and we need to take special measures.  This is mostly
    because the first bin (uniquely) is not guaranteed to be pulseDurMS from the second bin (phase is randomized
    on each trial by inserting a partial bin at the start of the sequence.
