function testFA2
%{
Simulate Poisson false alarms and reconstruct the rate parameter.  Poisson events have delays that are distributed
exponentially, so fitting an exponential to the distribution yields the rate parameter.  Many of our tasks involve
stimuli appearing after uniformly-distributed random delays.  False alarms can only occur before those stimuli, so
stimulus occurrences effectively truncate the detection of later false alarms.  Because the random stimulus timing
is is uniformly distributed, it is straightforward to compensate for these truncated trials.

This test displays three runs of the simulation.  The first has full trials with no truncations.  The performance
is good.  The second has truncated, uncorrected trials, for which the rate is systematically overestimated, particularly
for low rates. The third has truncated trials with false alarm counts that have been compensated for the truncation.

  We need to correct for the fact that we didn't allow for intervals greater than preStimMaxMS + tooFastMS.
  If we flip the axes on the exponential that defines the distribution of time to FA (y = exp(-L * x), we get 
  y = -1/L * log(x) (where L is lambda). We can get the average value of y (the FA period) by evaluating the
  integral over the interval from 0 to 1 ( = -x/L * (log(x) - 1), which reduces to 1/L over the interval 0-1).
  
  This integral assumes that the distribution extends to y = inf, but in fact we truncated it at 
  y = preStimMaxMS + tooFastMS, so the estimate of L is too large. We can correct this by finding the truncated
  distribution that has our average value. The truncation occurs at y = file.preStimMaxMS + file.tooFastMS.  This
  corresponds to an x value of xT = exp(-L * (file.preStimMaxMS + file.tooFastMS) / 1000.0).  To get the area of the
  truncated distribution, we remove the area in the exponential distribution from 0 to xT, then add back a retangular
  area corresponding to the xT * (file.preStimMaxMS + file.tooFastMS).
  
  The areas of in the exponential distribution from 0 to xT is -xT/L * (log(xT) - 1).  So we have the full distribution
    1.0 / L, minus the truncated portion, -xT/L * (log(xT) - 1) plus the rectangular region. The first to reduce to
    1.0 / L * (1.0 - xT * (log(xT) - 1))
